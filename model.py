    # Adds positional encodings (which are not learned, i.e., fixed) to the input embeddings x.
    # Passes the result through a dropout layer for regularization.
    # Returns the modified embeddings after dropout.
    # Example:
    # Assume x is a tensor of shape (batch_size=1, seq_len=5, d_model=6) (a sequence of length 5 with 6-dimensional token embeddings).
    # Positional encodings of shape (1, seq_len=5, d_model=6) are added to x.
    # Afterward, dropout is applied to the updated x, and the resulting tensor is returned for further layers in the model.

# now we will proceed for layer normalization
# Layer normalization is needed to stabilize and 
# accelerate training by normalizing the inputs across the features for 
# each data point (i.e., each sequence in a transformer). It helps ensure that 
# the input values have a consistent scale, which prevents the model from becoming 
# unstable and helps the model converge faster. By normalizing the inputs to have zero mean and 
# unit variance, layer normalization reduces internal covariate shift, allowing the model to better 
# handle changes in the distribution of inputs across layers.
